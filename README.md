# ArmenianWhisper

üéôÔ∏è **AI-powered Armenian Speech-to-English Subtitle Generator**

ArmenianWhisper is an open summer project that turns Armenian speech into accurate English subtitles. By pairing OpenAI Whisper with lightweight fine-tuning and community-curated datasets, it aims to make Armenian cultural content easier to share, archive, and access.

---

## üìå Overview

- Focuses on low-resource Armenian speech recognition and translation.
- Builds an end-to-end subtitle pipeline: transcription ‚Üí alignment ‚Üí translation.
- Prioritizes reproducibility so others can extend or adapt the work.
- Designed as a summer sprint with week-by-week milestones.

---

## üß† Motivation

Armenian remains underrepresented across modern AI tooling. ArmenianWhisper explores how open-source models and targeted LoRA fine-tuning can improve accessibility for Armenian audio content. The project blends language preservation, open research, and practical tooling for creators and archivists.

---

## üåü Feature Goals

- High-quality Armenian ASR with strong accent coverage.
- Reliable English subtitle generation with timing alignment (WhisperX).
- Evaluation dashboards for BLEU, WER, and latency metrics.
- Lightweight FastAPI backend for serving transcription + translation.
- Simple web UI prototype for uploading audio and exporting subtitles.

## üóìÔ∏è 10-Week Roadmap

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Set up dev environment; download and inspect datasets |
| 2 | Build a YouTube scraper for Armenian speech clips |
| 3 | Clean and quality-check aggregated datasets |
| 4 | Run LoRA fine-tuning on Whisper-small |
| 5 | Perform alignment (WhisperX) and evaluate BLEU/WER |
| 6 | Improve translation quality and add fallback pipelines |
| 7 | Implement the FastAPI backend |
| 8 | Prototype the frontend |
| 9 | Deploy with 8-bit quantization |
| 10 | Ship blog post, demo, and wrap-up üìΩÔ∏è |

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/armenian-whisper.git
cd armenian-whisper
git checkout tester
bash scripts/download_data.sh
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with the correct GitHub handle. The `scripts/download_data.sh` helper will pull the core datasets once implemented; for now, follow the dataset notes in `scripts/`.

---

## üìä Evaluation Toolkit (planned)

- BLEU and WER tracking notebooks in `notebooks/`.
- Alignment inspection via WhisperX outputs.
- Latency profiling for CPU/GPU inference paths.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Milestones

- [ ] Publish dataset download and cleaning scripts.
- [ ] Draft evaluation notebooks for BLEU/WER tracking.
- [ ] Stand up a FastAPI prototype with a translation endpoint.
- [ ] Explore lightweight UI concepts (Svelte vs React).

## ü§ù Contributing

Ideas, datasets, evaluation feedback, and GPU time are all welcome. Open an issue or start a discussion if you would like to collaborate or share benchmarks.

## üì¨ Stay in the Loop

Watch the repository or subscribe to project updates to follow along. Progress notes, training lessons, and demo clips will be shared once the first end-to-end pipeline is live.
